Project 1: Sales Data Analysis
During my internship, one of the main projects I worked on was a Sales Data Analysis project using Power BI. The goal was to understand how the company’s products were performing in different cities and during different times of the year.
First, I cleaned the raw data and created new fields like total sales, city, month, and hour of purchase. Then, I built an interactive dashboard that showed useful insights, like which products were selling the most, which cities had the highest revenue, and what time of the day people were shopping the most.
One interesting part was finding out which products were often bought together—this could help the business create combo offers. Overall, this project helped me learn how to turn raw data into meaningful business insights using visual tools.

Project 2: HR Employee Attrition Analysis
The second project I worked on was based on employee attrition—basically understanding why employees leave a company. I used a dataset with employee details like age, department, education, work experience, and job satisfaction.
Using Power BI, I analyzed different patterns to find what factors are linked to higher attrition. For example, I noticed that employees with poor work-life balance or fewer training opportunities were more likely to quit. I also compared attrition across departments and age groups.
This project helped me understand how data can support HR decisions, and how visual analytics can make it easier to identify and solve internal company issues.
